        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>Our story began when one of our members suddenly muttered, "We should have a place and content where we can
            hang the ideas we each want to do". In the beginning, we spent our days getting together and wasting time
            with idle talk and chit-chat. However, each member had a
            burning desire to create something innovative.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team leader kicked things off by saying, "Let's not just
            talk about it, let's put it into practice. Are you going to throw all the ideas you've had in the trash?".
            No one objected. The members of the team were of one mind from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was started with the idea of starting with something close to home. I am sure everyone who uses
            this page has different ideas. Some are looking for easy credits, some are looking for high quality classes.
            I hope this page will be useful for all of you.

        <h2>Our goal</h2>
        <p>
            We have no goal. Our dream is to contribute, even if only a little, to making this world a more convenient
            place to live. We believe that there are no limits. That is why we do not have a goal, but would like to
            keep running as far as we can.
        </p>
